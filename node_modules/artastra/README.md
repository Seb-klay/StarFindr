# ArtAstra.js
### BETA

This is a library for easily generating artistic representation of planets and other celestial objects. It works over three.js.

# Installation
`npm i artastra`

# Usage

Call _Create_ functions to make any planet:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';
import ArtAstra from 'artastra';

const AA = ArtAstra(THREE); //Initialize the library

var scene = new THREE.Scene();

const EarthRadius = 1 ;//Set scale of the models
const position = new THREE.Vector3(150,0,0); //Where you want your planet
const jupiter =  AA.CreateJupiter(EarthRadius, position);

scene.add(jupiter);

```

And add threejs code to render scene as usual.

Available objects: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.
You cand also create Random Stars with the method `CreateRandomStars()`. Textures can be dowloaded from the repo.
If you add the Sun to you model, you must call the method `UpdateSolarSystem();` every frame: 

```javascript
function animate() {

    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    AA.UpdateSolarSystem(scene, camera);

    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

```

You can create the entire solar system with the method `CreateSolarSystem();`

```javascript
var scene = new THREE.Scene();
CreateSolarSystem(scene);

```
It populates the scene with stars, a sun, the eigth planets, the earth's moon and a dwarf planet (Pluto).
